##React for iOS 

Welcome to my React native application for iOS. This is Music application to connect musicians with producers and get feedback on album statuses. I will be polling data from Spotify api and ReverbNation and twitter on recent tweets and most popular tracks online. React Native enables you to build world-class application experiences on native platforms using a consistent developer experience based on JavaScript and React. The focus of React Native is on developer efficiency across all the platforms
